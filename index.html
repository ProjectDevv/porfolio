      <p class="developer"> Becoming a developer is one of the many things I want to do in life. Creating your own projects and understanding new ways of thinking is a life full of learning and I want to hop on that train. The biggest thing I can look forward to is working with others and see how they do their work. All around the world there are many type of developers and to become one of them is what makes me excited to become a developer.
